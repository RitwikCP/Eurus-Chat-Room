# Eurus-Chat-Room
A project made as part of the "Core Java Programming" course during my first semester in college.

### AN OVERVIEW
The term "chatroom" is primarily used to describe any synchronous conferencing format, sometimes even asynchronous conferencing. Thus, the word can convey any technology, from real-time online chat and exchange with strangers (online forums, for example) to fully immersive graphical social environments. 
The immediate use of a chat room is to transmit information through text with a pack of other users. Commonly speaking, the capability to converse with numerous people in the same conversation distinguishes chat rooms from instant messaging programs, which are more naturally developed for one-to-one communication. 
The users in a particular chat room are usually connected via a shared internet or a similar connection, and chat rooms cater to a vast spectrum of subjects. 

This repository, in particular, contains all the files created as part of my submission of a mini-project for the Core Java Programming course in my college. Working on this made me confident in using IntelliJ and allowed me to implement concepts like OOPs, multithreading, etc., and socket programming techniques I learned throughout the semester. Java is a powerful programming language, and this project undoubtedly gives all beginners a taste of its capabilities.
